SlingShot App Launcher

This is an extension for Gnome Shell that adds a new application launcher,
modelled after SlingShot, the application launcher from Elementary OS
(http://www.elementaryos.org).

History of versions:

    1: First public version
    2: Highlights the icons when the mouse cursor files over them
    3: Code much more compliant with Gnome Shell style
    4: Fixed three forgotten "this."
    5: Allows to move the Activities button inside the menu and
       disable the hotspot
    6: Packed the schemas (forgotten in version 5)
    7: Better use of standard CSS
       Tries to keep the size of the meny as steady as possible, by
       tracking the maximum size used
    8: Reduces the icon matrix when the screen is small (based on code
       from kirby33)
       Now doesn't show empty pages
       Allows to customize the style of the main button (with/out icon
       or text)

       Now highlights all the possible buttons
    10: Keeps the window size even when changing the mode
    11: Allows to search apps using the keyboard
        Better appearance

        goes to Overview mode)
    13: Right Windows key shows AND closes the menu
    14: Improved icons
    15: Added configuration icon
        Only shows the SEARCH box when typing
    16: Allows to change the main button position in the top bar
